- Google OAuth
- Email/Password with magic links
- Optional: Discord OAuth (developer community)

## Tasks

- [ ] Install and configure NextAuth.js
- [ ] Set up GitHub OAuth provider
- [ ] Set up Google OAuth provider
- [ ] Create user model/schema in MongoDB
- [ ] Add session management
- [ ] Create protected API routes middleware
- [ ] Add login/logout UI components
- [ ] Implement user profile page
- [ ] Add auth state to global context
- [ ] Update all tools to support authenticated users

## Success Criteria

- Users can sign in with GitHub/Google
- Sessions persist across page reloads
- Protected routes redirect to login
- User info accessible throughout app

## Impact

HIGH - This is a foundational feature that enables all future personalization

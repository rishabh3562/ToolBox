## üöÄ ACTION REQUIRED: Update Your Issue Labels

Your Hacktoberfest issues currently have incorrect "bug" labels. Follow these simple steps to fix them:

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Actions

Open this link in your browser:

```
https://github.com/rishabh3562/ToolBox/actions/workflows/update-labels.yml
```

Or navigate manually:

1. Go to https://github.com/rishabh3562/ToolBox
2. Click the "Actions" tab
3. Click "Update Issue Labels" in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Workflow

1. Click the **"Run workflow"** dropdown button (top right, above the workflow runs list)
2. Leave "Branch: main" selected
3. Click the green **"Run workflow"** button

### Step 3: Wait for Completion

- The workflow will take ~30-40 seconds to complete
- You'll see a yellow dot while it's running
- Green checkmark when complete ‚úÖ
- Red X if there's an error ‚ùå

### Step 4: Verify Results

After the workflow completes:

1. Go to your issues: https://github.com/rishabh3562/ToolBox/issues
2. You should see proper labels on all 20 Hacktoberfest issues:

**Expected Label Distribution**:

- `security` - Authentication and security issues (2 issues)
- `database` - Storage and migration issues (1 issue)
- `enhancement` - Feature requests (8 issues)
- `testing` - Test-related issues (1 issue)
- `performance` - Optimization issues (1 issue)
- `accessibility` - A11y improvements (1 issue)
- `documentation` - Docs and guides (1 issue)
- `api` - API/SDK issues (1 issue)
- `mobile` - Mobile app issues (1 issue)
- `ai` - AI/ML features (1 issue)
- `devops` - CI/CD and deployment (1 issue)

**All issues will have**:

- `hacktoberfest` label
- `help wanted` label (where applicable)
- `good first issue` label (where applicable)

---

## üìä What the Workflow Does

The workflow will:

1. ‚úÖ Read your `.github/hacktoberfest-issues/ALL.md` file
2. ‚úÖ Find existing GitHub issues by matching titles
3. ‚úÖ Determine correct labels based on issue content
4. ‚úÖ Update labels via GitHub API
5. ‚úÖ Show summary of updates

**Safe Operation**:

- ‚ùå Will NOT recreate or delete issues
- ‚ùå Will NOT modify issue titles or descriptions
- ‚ùå Will NOT close any issues
- ‚úÖ ONLY updates labels
- ‚úÖ Can be run multiple times safely

## üîç Monitoring the Workflow

### While Running:

Click on the workflow run to see real-time logs:

- "Update labels on existing issues" job
- Watch as each issue is processed
- See which labels are applied

### If Something Goes Wrong:

The workflow includes detailed logging. Common issues:

**"Issue not found"**

- Issue title in ALL.md doesn't match GitHub issue title
- Issue was deleted or renamed
- Not a problem - workflow will continue with other issues

**"Rate limit exceeded"**

- Too many API calls
- Wait 1 hour and re-run
- Very unlikely with only 20 issues

**"Permission denied"**

- Repository permissions issue
- Should not happen (workflow has correct permissions)
- Contact GitHub support if this occurs

## üéØ What Happens Next

After successful label updates:

### For Contributors:

- Your issues will be properly categorized
- Easier for Hacktoberfest participants to find relevant issues
- Better filtering by label type
- More accurate skill matching

### For Your Project:

- Professional issue management
- Clear organization for open source contributors
- Better discoverability on GitHub
- Improved Hacktoberfest participation

## üìù Future Updates

If you add more issues to `ALL.md` in the future:

1. **To create new issues**: Run the "Hacktoberfest Setup" workflow
2. **To update existing labels**: Run the "Update Issue Labels" workflow

Both workflows are now available in your Actions tab!
